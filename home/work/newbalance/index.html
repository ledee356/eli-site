        Design exploratory work for New Balance's Always in Beta brand campaign
        and their All Roads Lead to New York campaign.
        All Road Lead to New York was created in part for their sponsorship of the 2017 NYC Marathon.
        I conceived and designed the pieces for the campaign which were inspired by the idea that
        as a runner all roads lead to the New York Marathon, and thus to New York.
        The pieces I created for that campaign were inspired by all the different modes of
        transportation one can use to get around and to New York City.
        This work was done while an intern at Nail Communications.
