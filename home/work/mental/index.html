            An exploration in capturing first hand experiences of mental health and mental illness.
            This is expressed through three videos designed to explore and capture specific these feelings.
            I chose to focus on Mania, Anxiety, and Depression.
            Each feeling is represented in a short video, and has an audio track created from a track of instrumental music as well as dialogue from someone who has dealt with these feelings first hand.
            Each video was designed in Adobe After Effects.
